## SCAN_Disk_Scheduling_in_c

### A. Problem Statement
Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO 
order,is:

86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130 

starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders)that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the SCAN disk-scheduling algorithms? 

### B. Build & Execute

Compile the code : ```gcc scan.c```<br>
Once the compilation is done, the a.out file created can be executed.
